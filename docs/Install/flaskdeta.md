# Installation

To use Flask-Deta in your Python project, you can easily install it using pip. Flask-Deta requires both Flask and the Deta library to function correctly. Fortunately, you don't need to worry about installing these dependencies separately, as Hatching (a Python package manager) will take care of installing them for you based on the information specified in the pyproject.toml file.

> âš  **Create a Virtual Environment (highly recommended)**: Before installing any Python package, it is a good practice to create and activate a virtual environment for your project to isolate its dependencies. [How to create virtual env.](venv.md)


## Install Flask-Deta

Once your virtual environment is activated, use pip to install Flask-Deta:
```bash
pip install Deta-Flask
```

After the installation is complete, you are ready to start integrating DetaSpace functionalities into your Flask application with Flask-Deta. Be sure to check out the documentation for more details on how to use the library effectively in your project.
