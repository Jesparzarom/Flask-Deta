# OVERVIEW

**Welcome to Flask-Deta documentation!**


Flask-Deta is a Python library that simplifies the integration of your [DetaSpace](https://deta.space/) collection of database and/or drive files with [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.3.x/) framework. 

With Flask-Deta, you can store and manage data with `DetaBase` and handle file storage operations with `DetaDrive`, all within the context of your Flask application. This robust combination allows you to leverage the secure and scalable cloud infrastructure of [DetaSpace](https://deta.space/), making data and file management for your web projects convenient. 

In this documents, we will provide you with an in-depth overview of Flask-Deta and help you get started using this extraordinary tool.

> With DetaSpace's free cloud storage you can easily store and manage data and files in your Flask applications.
