##### Installing via Pip [DEPRECATED]

> âš  **Deprecation Notice:** Due to the discontinuation of the Deta platform, `flask-deta` is no longer functional and will no longer receive updates. Installation and usage are no longer recommended. Deta has announced that all services, including data storage, will cease by **October 17, 2024**. Please export any necessary data before this date.

---

To previously incorporate Flask-Deta into your Python project, it was installed with pip:

```shell
pip install flask-deta
```

> âš  **Establish a Virtual Environment (highly recommended)**: Prior to installing any Python package, it is strongly advised to establish and activate a virtual environment tailored for your project. This practice ensures the segregation of dependencies. [Learn how to create a virtual environment](venv.md).

Once the installation process concludes, you'll be all set to seamlessly integrate DetaSpace functionalities into your Flask application with Flask-Deta. For a more comprehensive understanding of how to effectively employ this library within your project, remember to refer to the documentation.

##### Dependencies

The following dependencies were previously required for flask-deta, which would be installed automatically if missing:

- [x] Flask
- [x] deta
